# Authentication
Lendingkart apis uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get a  API key at our [developer portal](http://lendingkart.com).  

This Api expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:  `X-Api-Key: 'Your Api key'`


You must replace <code>Your Api key</code> with your personal API key.
